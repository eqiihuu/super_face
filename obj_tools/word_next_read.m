%% WORD_NEXT_READ "reads" words from a string, one at a time.
%
%  Special cases:
%
%    The following characters are considered to be a single word,
%    whether surrounded by spaces or not:
%
%      " ( ) { } [ ]
%
%    Also, if there is a trailing comma on the word, it is stripped off.
%    This is to facilitate the reading of lists.
%
%  Licensing:
%
%    This code is distributed under the GNU LGPL license.
%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, string S, a string, presumably containing words
%    separated by spaces.
%
%    Input, logical DONE.
%    TRUE, if we are beginning a new string;
%    FALSE, if we are continuing to process the current string.
%
%    Output, string WORD.
%    If DONE is FALSE, then WORD contains the "next" word read.
%    If DONE is TRUE, then WORD is blank, because there was no more to read.
%
%    Output, logical DONE.
%      FALSE if another word was read,
%      TRUE if no more words could be read.
%
  persistent lenc;
  persistent next;
  
  tab = char ( 9 );
%
%  We "remember" LENC and NEXT from the previous call.
%
%  An input value of DONE = TRUE signals a new line of text to examine.
